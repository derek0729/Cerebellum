# What is Unity? Game engine and IDE

Unity is a 3D/2D game engine and powerful cross-platform IDE for developers. As a game engine, Unity can provide many of the most important built-in features that make a game work. That means things like physics, 3D rendering, and collision detection. From a developer’s perspective, this means that there is no need to reinvent the wheel.
As well as a game engine, Unity is an IDE. IDE stands for “integrated development environment,” which describes an interface that gives you access to all the tools you need for development in one place. The Unity software has a visual editor that allows creators to simply drag and drop elements into scenes and then manipulate their properties.

# What language does Unity use?

 Unity supports the C# programming language natively. C# (pronounced C-sharp) is an industry-standard language like Java or C++.
C# scripts are the code files that store behaviors in Unity, powering everything the engine does. While there are a lot of new tools that will allow a developer to make a game without them, scripts are still the best way to create custom actions and interactions within a game space.

# What is Cerebellum and its Purpose?

Cerebellum is a response to accessibility in the Unity’s ecosystem in hopes of simplifying and helping newcomers and experiences developers to the gaming development space. Cerebellum’s objective is to be able help in the creations of Unity’s scripting system API in C#, since this developing process is sometimes more complicated than it needs to be, this language sets out to eliminate that transition in between scripts. 2-Dimensional Movement is the core objective of the language, to be able to simplify all movements in Unity’s system and can create different movement styles in your own format.

# Language Utilities
`1` Cerebellum is capable of translating C# code in to easy to learn grammar to be used in Unity

`2` Custom movement scripts

`3` Build scripts in code for Unity Game Engine
